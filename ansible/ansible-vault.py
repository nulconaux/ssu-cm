ansible_vault_pass
A small helper script for usage with ansible-vault and ansible-playbook
together with pass.
Written by Thomas Kerpe <toke@toke.de> - Public Domain
Say you have stored the vault-password for the current ansible playbook in pass
under the name ansible/demo/vault then either add a .pass_path file with the content
ansible/demo/vault or add a entry in the ansible.cfg:
    [pass]
    vault=ansible/demo/vault
Now you can call ansible-vault-pass to get the password for the vault.
It is especially useful like this:
    ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file ~/bin/ansible-vault-pass
or
    ansible-vault edit --vault-password-file ~/bin/ansible-vault-pass example.yml
Even more practical:
    export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/bin/ansible-vault-pass
then it will be used by default without specifying it. It is also useful in CI environments.
